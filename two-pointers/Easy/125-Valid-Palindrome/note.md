# Notes for Problem number 125 - Valid Palindrome

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/

## Key Concepts
- **The key concept of this problem is using two pointers to compare characters from both ends after preprocessing the string to remove non-alphanumeric characters.**

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Errors and How to Avoid Them

### 1. Using `char.isalnunm` instead of `char.isalnum()`:
- **Error**: Typo in method name or missing parentheses.
- **Reason**: `isalnum` is a method, not a variable. Forgetting the `()` will store a function reference, not a boolean value.
- **How to Avoid**: Always double-check method names and ensure you use parentheses when calling string methods.

### 2. Writing `char.lower` instead of `char.lower()`:
- **Error**: Lowercase conversion doesn‚Äôt happen.
- **Reason**: Similar to above, `lower` is a method that needs to be called.
- **How to Avoid**: Add `()` to properly convert the character to lowercase.

### 3. Comparing characters using fixed indices like `test[0] == test[-1]` in a loop:
- **Error**: Only compares the first and last characters, doesn't iterate.
- **Reason**: Logic does not account for the rest of the string.
- **How to Avoid**: Use a while loop with two pointers (`left`, `right`) and increment/decrement them in each iteration to compare all relevant characters.
