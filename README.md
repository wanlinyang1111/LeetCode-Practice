# LeetCode Practice

This repository documents my LeetCode practice journey, focusing on both code and conceptual understanding.

1. **Code**  
   Each solution is thoroughly commented, explaining the logic and purpose behind each step.

2. **Notes**  
   After practicing each problem at least five times, I consolidate key insights, mistakes, and lessons learned. These notes summarize common pitfalls, reasons for errors, and strategies to avoid them in the future.
