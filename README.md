# LeetCode Practice 📘✨

Hi! I'm Wanlin, a software engineering student currently sharpening my problem-solving skills through LeetCode. This repository documents my LeetCode practice journey, focusing on both code and conceptual understanding.

## 💻 Code 🔍
Each solution is thoroughly commented, explaining the logic and purpose behind each step.

## 📝 Notes 💡
After practicing each problem at least five times, I consolidate key insights, errors, and lessons learned. These notes summarize common pitfalls, reasons for errors, and strategies to avoid them in the future.

Feel free to explore and learn from my journey! 😊🚀
